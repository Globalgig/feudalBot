# FeudalBot

## About
FeudalBot is a discord bot which runs off the [discord.py API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and is built to emulate old clicker games like [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) with a cooperative twist.

FeudalBot requires a properly configured installation of [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a few necessary packages in order to get running. 

### Python Packages

1. [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
